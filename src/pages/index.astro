    Welcome to my corner of the internet!

  <p>
  I'm a Software Engineer and love to build solutions to improve people's lives. I've worked on infrustructure at Google Cloud Platform that's powered many apps + websites, was apart of a founding group to make email better, and currently am doing fun things with WebAssembly in the data streaming space.

  I put my trust in Jesus Christ as the son of God. All I do and all my accomplishments are because of Him, for Him and I pray that they ultimately point to Him.
